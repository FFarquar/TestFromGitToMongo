This project is a bit of a mess. I got stuck on basically, how to add the auth token to the HTTP request. I ended up sticking the token in a header, 
but this caused a lot of probs in how to register the service, as I needed to inject the local storage service to get details from the browser storage

After a lot of playing around, came across a tutorial on how to use HTTP Client (and next HTTPFactory) for ASP pages. Seems to hold for Blazor.

I've been through the first tutorial https://code-maze.com/fetching-data-with-httpclient-in-aspnetcore/ and have managed to modify
IHttpClientServiceImplementation HttpClientServiceImplementation to call my bike api AND insert the auth token into the header

THIS METHOD OF ADDING THE SERVICE DIDNT WORK WITH injecting other services into the HTPP client
builder.Services.AddScoped( sp =>
{
    return new HttpClient(new AddHeadersDelegatingHandler())
    {
        BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress)
};
});

I have to continue with the tutorial to read about factories so that I dont need HTTP Clients in each service. I also removed the BikeServiceClient, but it will need
to be refactored so that it can be used. At the moment HttpClientCrudService is rigged up to getBikes from the API

Have the source code for web tutorial in HttpTesting.sln
